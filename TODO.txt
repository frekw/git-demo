# Tasks

## BUG-1
The logo is all wrong. Fix it. Real logo: http://goo.gl/Y8VLw

## BUG-2
We seem to be getting a script error. Fix it.

## BUG-3
Someone seems to have left an unfinished feature in the code base. Clicking the Ask button should prompt the user for his/her name, and update the input/message appropriately. (Hint: use prompt(msg)).

*NOTE* Don't merge this branch directly into master from git. Instead, use Github's pull request feature to get to know how their code review tool.

## FEATURE-1
The box which displays the user's name should also greet the user (e.g Hi, Name!).

## FEATURE-2
There's an unfinished validator in 'feature-name_validation'. Finish it.

## FEATURE-3
Wouldn't it be lovely if the text input changed color when validation fails. Hint: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#inputWarning

# Rules
Only one change/feature/fix per commit. Commits touching multiple things will be rejected (that is, if your commit message contains the word "and").

Write proper commit messages using capitlization and proper punctuation, or your pull request will get rejected.

Create a new branch for each fix.

Let's keep our history clean, rebase before pushing, or your pull request will get rejected.
